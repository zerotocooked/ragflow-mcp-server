# Sample Document for RAGFlow Testing

This is a sample document that can be used to test the RAGFlow MCP Server.

## Machine Learning Concepts

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms
that can learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous values
2. **Decision Trees**: Good for classification and regression tasks
3. **Neural Networks**: Powerful for complex pattern recognition

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is crucial for machine learning success:

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove or handle missing values
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize data ranges
- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features

## Model Evaluation

Common metrics for evaluating models:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
